# Description
The task of this challenge was to build a back end for e-commerce sity by modifying the starter code provided. I configured a working Express.js API which uses sequlize to interact with a MySQL database. A video walkthrough is provided to demonstarte the functionality of the challenge. 

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

# Installation
To run the application, please install necessary npm modules through the command line. Enter your authentications into the `.env` file to run MySQL database and source the `schema.sql` file. After creating the models, routes and databases, run `npm run seed` and run `npm start`.
